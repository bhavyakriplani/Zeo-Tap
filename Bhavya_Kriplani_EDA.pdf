eCommerce Transactions Analysis

Business Insights from EDA

1. Regional Revenue Distribution
North America contributes the most to revenue (~40%), followed by Europe (30%) and Asia (20%). This shows that sales are uneven across regions, and there’s potential to increase sales in Asia with better marketing.

2. Best-Selling Products
The Electronics category makes up most of the revenue (~50%). Books and Clothing are also popular but generate less income. Focusing on electronics and promoting other categories might help balance sales.

3. Older Customers Are More Valuable
Customers who signed up before 2022 spend more ($300 per transaction) compared to newer customers ($180). This means older customers are more loyal and valuable, so retention efforts should target them.

4. Sales Spike in Q4
Sales go up a lot during October to December (Q4), likely because of the holiday season. Offering discounts and promotions during this time can increase revenue even more.

5. Price and Quantity Relationship
Lower-priced products (<$50) sell in large quantities, while high-priced products ($500+) sell fewer units but contribute a lot to revenue. A mix of both types is important to appeal to different customers.

Conclusion and Recommendations
	1.	Advertise more in regions like Asia to grow sales there.
	2.	Promote high-margin categories like Electronics but don’t ignore smaller ones.
	3.	Reward loyal customers with special discounts or offers.
	4.	Focus on holiday promotions in Q4 to maximize revenue.
	5.	Keep a mix of affordable and premium products for all types of customers.
